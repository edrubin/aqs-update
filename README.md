# aqs monitoring updates

This repo/project explores (and aims to help explain) the policy and research implications of recent updates to FEM AQS monitor data.

## data

I downloaded the AQS data from the EPA's page for pregenerated files, *i.e.*, 
<br>[https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/airdata/download_files.html](https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/airdata/download_files.html)
<br>Download date: 2024-11-08

I've included the raw (zipped) daily files in the repo. The hourly files are too large and should be downloaded on the EPA's page (above).
